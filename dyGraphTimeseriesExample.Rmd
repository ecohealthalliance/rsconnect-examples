## using dygraph for timeseries

[`dygraphs`](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/index.html) is a library for creating interactive timeseries plots. It uses [`xts`](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/xts) objects to create the plots. `xts` builds off of timeseries classes found in the `zoo` package. Unlike ggplot

```{r dygraph example, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(xts)
library(dygraphs)
library(magrittr)

## creating a data frame with data and time fields
df <- data.frame(x = 10*(sin(1:10)+1), date = as.Date(1:10))

# creating xts object x = data, order.by = time
xtsObj <- xts(x = df$x,order.by =  df$date)

# can label data by naming the object or using the 
# label argument in the dySeries function
names(xtsObj) <- "Some Name"

dygraph(xtsObj, main = "A test plot's title") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector() %>% #plot also has brush based selection
  dyOptions(stepPlot = FALSE,
            drawPoints = TRUE,
            pointSize = 3, 
            fillGraph = FALSE,
            colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1"))
